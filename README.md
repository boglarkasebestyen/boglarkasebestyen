### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bogi!
Hi, I'm BoglÃ¡rka SebestyÃ©n. I'm passionate about web development, mainly front-end. Based in the US, San Francisco Bay Area.

I love to personalize, give a fun twist to the apps that I write, no matter if they're the main project for any of the courses I have completed or something I came up with out of the blue. 

Although, I've always preferred to spend my free time with more artistic activities, I realized in the past few years that from a creative standpoint, I would much rather build functional websites/apps instead of just laying out the design. For example, when I wrote the static websites as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course, I really wished I knew JavaScript to bring them to life. 

Currently, I'm strengthening my skills in React (both React.js and Native) to build more projects. 
I'm also interested in learning Typescript, and more about CSS & JS/React animations.
