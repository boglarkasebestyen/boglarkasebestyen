### Hi there 👋, I'm Bogi!
Hi, I'm Boglárka Sebestyén. I'm passionate about web development, mainly front-end. Based in the US, San Francisco Bay Area.

- I love to personalize, give a fun twist to the apps that I write, no matter if they're the main project for any of the courses 
I have completed or something I came up with out of the blue. 

- Although, I've always preferred to spend my free time with more artistic activities, I realized in the past few years that from 
a creative standpoint, I would much rather build functional websites/apps instead of just laying out the design. 
For example, when I wrote the static websites as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course, I really wished I knew 
JavaScript to bring them to life. 

- Currently, I'm strengthening my skills in React (both React.js and Native) to build more projects. 
I'm also interested in learning Typescript, and more about CSS & JS/React animations.


🌱 Skills: React.js, React Native, Node.js, GraphQL, MongoDB
